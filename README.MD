older python version installed? use python's build in uninstaller and **manualy** remove python from included paths.

pip should already be included when installing python.
if this refuses to work for you, fuck you, fix it your self [here](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) or [here](https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/pip-command-not-found)
# packages
> pip install playwright

installs a python library called [playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/).
# after installing playwright
> playwright install

this second command will be neccesary to install chromium needed for playwright.

need help installing playwright?
take a look [here](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro).
