install python v 3.10 or higher [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
make sure to 'include in path' during install.

older python version installed? use python's build in uninstaller and remove python from included paths.

pip should already be included when installing python.
if this refuses to work for you, fuck you, fix it your self [here](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) or [here](https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/pip-command-not-found)
# packages
> pip install playwright

installs a python library called [playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/).
# after installing playwright
> playwright install

this second command will be neccesary to install chromium needed for playwright.

take a look [here](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro).
